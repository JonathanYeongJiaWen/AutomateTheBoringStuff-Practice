#Coin Flip Streaks
For this exercise, we’ll try doing an experiment. If you flip a coin 100 times and write down an “H” for each heads and “T” for each tails, you’ll create a list that looks like “T T T T H H H H T T.” 
If you ask a human to make up 100 random coin flips, you’ll probably end up with alternating head-tail results like “H T H T H H T H T T,” which looks random (to humans), but isn’t mathematically random. 
A human will almost never write down a streak of six heads or six tails in a row, even though it is highly likely to happen in truly random coin flips. Humans are predictably bad at being random.
Write a program to find out how often a streak of six heads or a streak of six tails comes up in a randomly generated list of heads and tails. Your program breaks up the experiment into two parts: 
the first part generates a list of randomly selected 'heads' and 'tails' values, and the second part checks if there is a streak in it. 
Put all of this code in a loop that repeats the experiment 10,000 times so we can find out what percentage of the coin flips contains a streak of six heads or tails in a row. 
As a hint, the function call random.randint(0, 1) will return a 0 value 50% of the time and a 1 value the other 50% of the time.

        if all(lst[i + j] == 'H' for j in range(streaklength)) or all(lst[i + j] == 'T' for j in range(streaklength)):
            return True
    return False

for a in range(10000):
    # Code that creates a list of 100 'heads' or 'tails' values.
    lst = generateflips(100)
    # Code that checks if there is a streak of 6 heads or tails in a row.
    if hasstreak(lst, streaklength):
        numberOfStreaks += 1

percentage = numberOfStreaks / 100
print('Chance of streak:' + str(percentage) + '%')
